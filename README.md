# PID Loop Practice

This repo simulates a wheel that we can apply torque to.

We need to figure out how to write a PID loop to allow it to go quickly to specific rotations.

Code to control it will go in HoldPositionController.

## How to Run
In Unix
```bash
./gradlew run
```

Or in Windows
```bash
gradlew.bat run
```
